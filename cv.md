### Summary
I am changing my career guidance. In programming, in addition to the magic that occurs when writing code, I am attracted by great financial opportunities and the possibility of relocation. I participate in various frontend development courses held in our city. Iâ€™m looking for an opportunity to get an internship in one of the IT companies in order to use the acquired knowledge and improve my qualifications.
